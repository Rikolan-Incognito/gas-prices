# gas-prices

Baltic Gas prices are derived from "https://gas.didnt.work/?country=" website that is, in turn, based on Waze responses. This Scriptable widget may have a few bugs or mistakes, but overall it should work well enough to provide you current prices adequately. However, it should be noted that if gas.didnt.work website should change its format, the script may break.

By running the main script, it will ask for a user's country, gas station company, location of said gas station and then widget color. After input, a new script will be created in app, that will work as a widget with these set preferences. These additional scripts can be created or deleted how many times one may like. In addition, these widget scripts don't need the main app to function.
