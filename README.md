# gas-prices

Gas prices are derived from "https://gas.didnt.work/?country=" website that is, in turn, based on Waze responses. This Scriptable widget may have a few bugs or mistakes, but overall it should work well enough to provide you current prices adequately. However, it should be noted that if gas.didnt.work website should change its format, the script may break.
